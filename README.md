## Summary

## Projects

### Joining a Platoon  
Worked on developing a system for autonomous vehicles to join a vehicle platoon seamlessly. The project involved implementing algorithms that enabled vehicles to join, leave, and maintain formation in a platoon with minimal disruption.

- **Role**: Developer - Focused on Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) communication, ensuring efficient data transmission between vehicles and the central network for coordination within the platoon.

- **Technologies Used**: Python, ROS (Robot Operating System), Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle-to-Network (V2N) Communication Protocols  

- **Key Achievements**:
  - Developed robust communication channels between vehicles using ROS publisher and subscriber mechanisms for real-time data exchange.  
  - Successfully implemented Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAM) by processing data received from various vehicle components, enabling coordinated decision-making within the platoon.

### Evaluation of Composite Materials with Nano Fillers
Conducted a comparative analysis of composite materials with varying amounts of TiO2 nano fillers, evaluating their properties through physical tests and CAD analysis.

- **Role**: Team Lead - Directed the team in experimental design and analysis.  
- **Technologies Used**: ANSYS, Mechanical Testing Machines, Water Absorptivity Test  
- **Key Achievements**:  
  - Identified optimal TiO2 filler amount and compared physical test results with CAD analysis.

### Energy Conservation in Bicycle Using Flywheel
Designed a flywheel system to conserve kinetic energy in bicycles, optimizing energy use during cycling.

- **Role**: Team Lead - Managed the design and implementation of the energy conservation system.  
- **Technologies Used**: Siemens NX (Design and Simulation), Real-life implementation  
- **Key Achievements**:  
  - Successfully conserved kinetic energy and developed a system for accessing stored energy when needed.
